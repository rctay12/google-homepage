For this HTML/CSS project I will be deconstructing and rebuilding Google's homepage stylistically. 

After finishing this up, I have learned to use flexbox, how to hook elements, link files together, my git and github is getting better, my understanding of html is getting better, I learned a lot my about vscode and chrome dev tools... really the list goes on.
